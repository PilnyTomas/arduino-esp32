# I2S  / IIS / Inter-IC Sound

This library is base od Arduino I2S library (see doc [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/i2s))
This library mimics the behavior and extends possibilities with ESP-specific functionalities.
For example Arduino I2S can operate on 8, 16 and 32 bits per sample, ESP adds 24 bits per sample.
In this document you will find description of functionality which is not available in Arduino and therefore is not described in the Arduino documentation.
